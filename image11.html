     <center><p style="text-align: center; font-family: courier; font-size: larger;"> I created a stylized version of the alphabet using a limited number of shapes provided. It was necessary to keep them consistent throughout, as I was essentially creating a typeface. With the shapes provided, I was able to create a sharp and angular pattern throughout.
