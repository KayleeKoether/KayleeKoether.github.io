     <center><p style="text-align: center; font-family: courier; font-size: larger;">I created this collage for a final project and the main goal was to incorporate what we learned in the semester. I learned about design rules and color schemes, so I went with an analogous color palette and geometric and organic shapes combined. I used textiles in the background shaped into squares and rectangles, then added flowers and dancers on top to balance the design out.
