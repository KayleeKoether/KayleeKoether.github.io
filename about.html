     <center><div id="left"><p style="font-family: courier;">Hello, my name is Kaylee Koether. I 
        currently reside in Milton, Florida and have lived there for the majority of my life. I am working towards my bachelorâ€™s degree in graphic design at the 
        University of West Florida. 
        I have been interested in my field and working towards it for about eight years from middle school, to high school, and now college. All forms of art seem 
        exciting to me, and I try to explore them in my spare time, but career-wise my strengths fall under graphic design. I am passionate about creating works, such as posters, and focusing on the layouts and typography, among other elements, that go into it. I try to incorporate what I know about other art forms into my designs 
        as well. 
        My portfolio showcases various projects I have created such as sculptures, 
        collages, paintings, and poster and 
        typographical designs. Viewing each work individually and altogether can show the principles I have learned and how they can relate to each other in my 
        work overall.</p></div>
      
     <div id="right"><p style="font-family: courier;">I am skilled and certified in 
        various Adobe programs, such as Illustrator, Photoshop, and 
        Indesign, among others. I have used these to be aquainted with and succeed in using various 
        design principles. Examples 
        include composition, 
        typography, and color 
        combinations. With skills such as these and alike, I have created 
        posters, collages, and 
        other artworks.
        I hope to incorporate these skills into my future work. My strengths would overall be in 
        design work, which I hope to 
        engage with in the future 
        as well.</p></div>
