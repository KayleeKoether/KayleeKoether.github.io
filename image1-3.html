     <center><p style="text-align: center; font-family: courier; font-size: larger;">The goal of this project was to create three collages, with one of each representing our mind, body, and spirit. Word associations were used to pick out the individual figures I would add into the collages, such as a kitten for a child-like and playful spirit. Photo-editing techniques were implemented, such as scaling, changing hues, and cropping images. Another important detail to this project was that all three collages needed to visually go with one another, whether it was through color or a recurring element throughout. I used both through adding water in each collage, along with the color blue.
