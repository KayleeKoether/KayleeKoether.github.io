     <center><p style="text-align: center; font-family: courier; font-size: larger;"> This painting was a complex and interpretive abstract painting with guidelines to follow. We had to choose from a given set of colors to incorporate into our complementary, split complementary, and triadic sections. We also had to choose an individual color that would be seen across each panel and fit with the other chosen colors as well. The goal was to show our understanding of each of these sections and how colors can relate to one another.
