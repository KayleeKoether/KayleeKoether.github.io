     <center><p style="text-align: center; font-family: courier; font-size: larger;"> This project had the goal of creating a poster using a font chosen from a list of fonts provided while using only black and white as well. It had to be made almost entirely out of typography in order to truly showcase the font chosen. It was also necessary to learn the history of the font and incorporate it into the poster.
