     <center><p style="text-align: center; font-family: courier; font-size: larger;">For this project, a figure of our choice was to be created solely using typography. Word association was used to pair words together that related to ourselves and the subject at the same time. Each word needed a unique appearance and some needed to be emphasized more than others. Color usage was also implemented to reflect the image.
