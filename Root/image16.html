     <center><p style="text-align: center; font-family: courier; font-size: larger;"> This is a 3D model with LEDs built into it. The goal was to learn and establish design principles using CAD and electronics. The was free range to choose our figure for the model, though it had to be stable enough to stand on its own. I also had to choose a figure that would be able to be hollowed out in certain areas in order to snake the LEDs up into it. This project overall helped me to learn about the time and thought process that goes into making such a model and the techniques paired with the creation.
