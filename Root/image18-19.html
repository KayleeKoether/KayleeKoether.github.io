     <center><p style="text-align: center; font-family: courier; font-size: larger;"> These sculptures are a pair, although they had different materials required to create them.There was overall supposed to be a great contrast between the two in various ways. The first of the pair needed wood glue, balsa wood, ink, and a soft material of our choice, which I chose the string for. It overall has a spider web-like appearance, along with being lighter and more detailed than the second sculpture. The second is more structured and its main focus was masking tape. It was purposefully supposed to be bigger in order to give a scale contrast between the two sculptures.
