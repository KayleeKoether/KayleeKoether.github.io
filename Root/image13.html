     <center><p style="text-align: center; font-family: courier; font-size: larger;"> This project focused on using various contrasts and demonstrating our knowledge of the tools in Adobe Illustrator. We could choose any two letters we desired, though they had to be in different fonts as well. We also had to use black and white for the initial letter, then gray for the following. I chose the letter “K” to use with black and white and changed the positioning in each panel. I varied the scaling with the letter “A” and moved it in front of some “K’s” and behind some. This project overall helped to show relation among different sizes, colors, and positions.
