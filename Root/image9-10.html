     <center><p style="text-align: center; font-family: courier; font-size: larger;"> These posters were created in order to show the steps that go into a chosen design process. The intention was to create a typographical poster and learn about the chosen process, and to help viewers learn and understand the process as well. I chose electrotyping and learned about the many steps that go into it and used design principles I learned in order to execute it efficiently on the poster.
